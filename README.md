# HPC-Server-Issue-Tracker
Post any questions, bugs, and feature/update requests here.

## Posting an Issue
In the top bar find "Issues". Click that to be taken to the Issues page, where all open bugs and feature requests for the HPC server can be seen. Before posting your own issue search to see if anyone else has had a similar problem. If no duplicate issues exist then click the green "New Issue" button in the top right corner. Here you can select from some premade templates:
1. Application/Library Update Request -- where you can make a case for installing an upstream version of an application
2. Bug Report -- where you can report problems with the HPC Server

Click the "Get Started" button next to either of those to begin writing. If you have a more open ended question that doesn't fit these templates you can click "Open a blank issue" below. Once you've started writing your issue be as precise and detailed as you can. Walk us through what you were doing when you encountered the problem and the steps to reproduce it. Once you're finished click the green "Submit new issue" button and give us admins some time to work on your problem. [This](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) documentation will walk you through setting up Github notifications so you can get emails when your issue is updated.
